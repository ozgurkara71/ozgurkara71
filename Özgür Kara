I'm ozgur. I'm computer engineering student 2. class. I want to be a game designer. I love character, vehicle and game map modeling etc.
I like coding. I know C and Python and will learn C++. I'm learning Blender 3D now. I would like to add Unreal Game Engine, Maya and 
3ds Max to the list as well. 
I love learning. I think it's fabulous to not be able to move anywhere without knowing anything and to fly and see everything after grinding and learning.
